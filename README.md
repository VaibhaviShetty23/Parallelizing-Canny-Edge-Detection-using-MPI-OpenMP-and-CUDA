# Parallelizing-Canny-Edge-Detection-using-MPI-and-OpenMP
Edge detection is key in image processing, with Canny being popular for its accuracy and noise reduction. However, it's computationally intensive for large images. To improve performance, we parallelize the Canny algorithm using MPI and OpenMP, combining distributed and shared memory parallelism.
